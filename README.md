Hong Kong Temperature Distribution Map

This project visualises the temperature distribution across Hong Kong in a visually appealing manner. Temperatures are linearly interpolated between observation stations, with four virtual stations positioned at each corner, assigned the mean temperature of all stations.

âš  Note: This interpolation is for visualisation purposes only and does not represent the actual temperature distribution.

New version of the script should generate output in 10 seconds, given the coastline shapes and polygons are already rendered. Future improvements will focus on integrating numerical model outputs could further enhance the accuracy and applicability of the visualisation. Extension can be made to plot other meteorological variables such as humidity, wind and wind direction.
