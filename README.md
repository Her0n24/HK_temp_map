Hong Kong Temperature Distribution Map

This project visualises the temperature distribution across Hong Kong in a visually appealing manner. Temperatures are linearly interpolated between observation stations, with four virtual stations positioned at each corner, assigned the mean temperature of all stations.

âš  Note: This interpolation is for visualisation purposes only and does not represent the actual temperature distribution.

Currently, plotting takes up to 5 minutes due to the repetitive rendering of coastline shapes and polygons. Future improvements will focus on optimising computation and reducing plotting time. Additionally, integrating numerical model outputs could further enhance the accuracy and applicability of the visualisation.
